# Metrics Dashboard

Feature ID: inventory.metrics.dashboard

## Overview
The Metrics Dashboard summarizes inventory activity and trends using aggregated action metrics. It provides company-level insights and, for super users, platform-level summaries.

## Tier Availability
- Professional
- Business
- Enterprise

## How It Works
- Company view aggregates daily action metrics for the active company.
- Platform view is available to super users and aggregates metrics across all companies.
- Users can adjust the date range to see recent activity trends.

## Limitations
- Metrics are based on daily aggregates, not real-time events.
- Only actions tracked in action_metrics are included.
- No export or custom report builder in Phase 1B.

## Support Expectations
Users may ask how metrics are derived and why counts differ from raw tables. Support should explain daily aggregation and action-based counting.
