Feature ID: inventory.reports.inventory

## Overview

## Tier Availability
- Starter
- Professional
- Business
- Enterprise

## How It Works
- The report compiles current inventory data from the active company.
- Low-stock items are highlighted with thresholds and reorder actions.
- Users can download a CSV or copy an email-ready report summary.

## Limitations
- Reports reflect current inventory only; no historical snapshots.
- Email delivery relies on the user’s email client or copy workflow.
- Report content is limited to fields shown in the report UI.

## Support Expectations
Users may ask why counts differ from expectations or how low-stock thresholds are calculated. Support should verify thresholds and current inventory state.
