# Order Recipients

Feature ID: inventory.orders.recipients

## Overview
Order Recipients surfaces previously used recipient emails to speed up future order sends.

## Tier Availability
- Business
- Enterprise

## How It Works
- Recipient emails are saved when an order is sent.
- Start typing to see recent recipients for the active company.
- Selecting a suggestion fills the recipient field.

## Limitations
- Suggestions are limited to saved recipients for the active company.
- There is no bulk edit or cleanup UI for saved recipients.

## Support Expectations
Users may ask why a recipient is not appearing; support should confirm the order was sent successfully and from the same company.
