# Inventory Import/Export

Feature ID: inventory.inventory.import_export

## Overview
Bulk import/export lets teams load inventory data from files or paste, and export inventory to CSV.

## Tier Availability
- Professional
- Business
- Enterprise

## How It Works
- Import supports file uploads and paste-based data entry.
- Imports update existing items when names match, otherwise new items are created.
- Export generates a CSV of active inventory items.

## Limitations
- Import expects item name, description, and quantity columns.
- Only active (non-deleted) items are exported.
- Large imports may take longer depending on dataset size.

## Support Expectations
Users may need help preparing their files or understanding which items were updated. Support should confirm the name matching behavior.
