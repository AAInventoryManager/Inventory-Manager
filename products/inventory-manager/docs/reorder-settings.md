# Reorder Settings

Feature ID: inventory.inventory.reorder

## Overview
Reorder Settings let you mark items for reordering and capture reorder-specific thresholds and quantities that are distinct from low stock alerts.

## Tier Availability
- Starter
- Professional
- Business
- Enterprise

## How It Works
- Enable reorder settings on an item to track reorder point and reorder quantity.
- Reorder settings are independent from low stock thresholds.
- Reports and views can surface items marked for reorder when available.

## What It Does Not Do
- Does not automatically place purchase orders.
- Does not send supplier emails or notifications.
- Does not adjust inventory quantities on its own.

## Limitations
- Reorder settings apply per item and require manual configuration.
- Reorder thresholds are informational unless used with other workflows.

## Support Expectations
Users may ask how reorder settings differ from low stock alerts. Support should confirm that low stock is a visual alert, while reorder settings capture intended reorder quantities.
