# Invitations

Feature ID: inventory.auth.invite_users

## Overview
Invitations let admins invite new users to a company and assign an initial role. An invite produces a time-limited link that the recipient must accept.

## Tier Availability
- Business
- Enterprise

## How It Works
- Admins send an invite by email with a selected role.
- The system generates a unique invite link with an expiration window.
- The recipient must accept the invitation while signed in with the invited email.

## Limitations
- A user can belong to only one company in Phase 1.
- Invites expire and must be reissued after expiration.
- Invites are blocked if the company is not on a Business or Enterprise tier.

## Support Expectations
Invite issues often relate to expired links or email mismatches. Support should verify the email, tier eligibility, and invitation status.
