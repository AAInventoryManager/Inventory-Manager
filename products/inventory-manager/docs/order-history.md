# Order History

Feature ID: inventory.orders.history

## Overview
Order History provides a record of submitted orders, including their contents and receiving status, so teams can track what has been ordered and received.

## Tier Availability
- Business
- Enterprise

## How It Works
- Submitted orders are listed chronologically.
- Users can view order details and notes.
- Receiving actions update inventory when enabled.

## Limitations
- Past orders are read-only; line items cannot be edited.
- Receiving relies on matching line items to current inventory records.
- History is scoped to the active company.

## Support Expectations
Users may need guidance on receiving workflows or understanding why a line item did not update inventory. Support should confirm inventory matching behavior.
