# Inventory Trash

Feature ID: inventory.inventory.trash

## Overview
Inventory Trash provides soft delete and restore for inventory items.

## Tier Availability
- Starter
- Professional
- Business
- Enterprise

## How It Works
- Deleting an item moves it to trash instead of removing it permanently.
- Restore returns the item to the active inventory list.
- Trash actions are restricted by delete and restore permissions.

## Limitations
- Permanent deletion is not available.
- Only deleted items appear in the trash list.

## Support Expectations
Users may need help restoring items or understanding delete permissions. Support should confirm who can delete or restore items.
