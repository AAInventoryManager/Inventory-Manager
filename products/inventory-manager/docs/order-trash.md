# Order Trash

Feature ID: inventory.orders.trash

## Overview
Order Trash allows authorized users to move orders to trash and restore them when needed.

## Tier Availability
- Business
- Enterprise

## How It Works
- Delete an order from history to move it to trash.
- Restore a deleted order to make it visible again.
- Actions are logged for audit and metrics tracking.

## Limitations
- Only users with delete/restore permissions can manage trashed orders.
- Trashed orders are soft-deleted; permanent deletion is not available.

## Support Expectations
Users may request help restoring orders or clarifying who can delete them. Support should confirm role permissions and tier requirements.
