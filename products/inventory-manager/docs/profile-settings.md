# Profile Settings

Feature ID: inventory.auth.profile_settings

## Overview
Profile Settings lets users manage their personal information, notification preferences, and password updates.

## Tier Availability
- Starter
- Professional
- Business
- Enterprise

## How It Works
- Update your name, phone number, and delivery address.
- Configure low stock preferences (global threshold and alert visibility).
- Change your password from within the app.

## Security Expectations
- Password changes require your current session.
- Profile changes apply only to your account.
- Settings do not affect other users unless explicitly shared.

## What It Does Not Support
- Changing another user’s profile.
- Editing company-wide settings.
- Password policy customization.

## Support Expectations
Users may ask how to update contact details or low stock preferences. Support should direct them to Profile Settings and confirm changes apply immediately.
