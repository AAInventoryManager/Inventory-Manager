# Role Change Requests

Feature ID: inventory.auth.role_requests

## Overview
Role Change Requests allow users to request a different role. Admins can review and approve or deny those requests.

## Tier Availability
- Business
- Enterprise

## How It Works
- Users submit a request with the desired role and optional reason.
- Admins review pending requests and approve or deny them.
- Approved requests update the user’s role immediately.

## Limitations
- Only one pending request per user at a time.
- Requests apply only to the user’s current company.
- Role approvals are limited to admin permissions.

## Support Expectations
Users may ask why a request is blocked or still pending. Support should confirm tier eligibility and whether an admin has reviewed the request.
