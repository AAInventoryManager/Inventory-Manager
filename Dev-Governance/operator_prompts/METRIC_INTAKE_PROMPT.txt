You are defining a new inventory metric for an enterprise SaaS platform.

This platform treats metrics as first-class, governed artifacts.
No metric may be implemented without a complete, approved definition.

Your task:
Produce a single metric definition using the canonical metric_definition.yaml template.

Rules you must follow:
- Every metric must have a unique metric_id.
- The pricing tier entitlement must be explicitly stated.
- The mathematical formula must be written explicitly (no prose-only descriptions).
- Every variable used in the formula must be defined in plain English.
- Time semantics must be clear (as-of vs period-based).
- All supported dimensions must be listed.
- Edge cases must be explicitly handled (division by zero, missing data, negative values).
- At least two test cases must be provided with known inputs and expected outputs.

Constraints:
- Do not write UI code.
- Do not write SQL unless explicitly requested.
- Do not assume data exists unless it is explicitly named in the definition.
- Do not compute metrics for tiers that are not entitled.

If any required information is missing or ambiguous, stop and request clarification
instead of guessing.

Output only a valid metric_definition.yaml document.
