After feature implementation:

1) Identify required test layers per TESTING_POLICY.md
2) Add unit tests for new logic
3) Add backend entitlement/policy tests for tier and permission behavior
4) Add integration tests for RPC or RLS changes
5) Run tests or explicitly report unrun tests with justification
6) Summarize failures in actionable terms

Do not rely on UI behavior as proof of correctness.
